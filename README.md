Notes  
---------------
* The sfx folder and pyMusic.py need to be in the same folder  
* Append features to directory to toggle them (in this case, shuffle and list)  
  * `C:\your\music\directory\?shuffle?list`  
* Leaving the directory blank will cause the player to use the desktop as the chosen directory  
  * typing a folder name that is on your desktop will set that folder as the chosen directory  
* Sometimes a high enough bitrate file will cause a PlaysoundException, which is handled:  
  * plays an alert noise (don't worry, it's not loud)  
  * prints ` | bitrate too high | ` in front of the title  
  * waits for user input to continue
